In a pretty big commit:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/servermon/servermon/commit/b4dfd58a85ab52aaf57a2c360a94ea190065459f"&gt;b4dfd58&lt;/a&gt;
we 've reached almost full compliance. The one error ignored is E501
(line too long) which did not seem worthy to fight for. So, now
patches/PRs to servermon need to keep code style, pass the tests and
not make code coverage significantly worse to be accepted&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alexandros Kosiaris</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2015 14:39:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.uname.gr,2015-09-17:servermon-flake8-compliant.html</guid><category>servermon</category><category>monitoring</category><category>puppet</category><category>django</category></item><item><title>Servermon code coverage &gt; 95%</title><link>http://blog.uname.gr/servermon-code-coverage-95.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, happy to shared with you that I 've managed to get servermon's
code coverage finally above 95%. 96.37 to be exact. This means only ~100
relevant LOC are not being actively tested right now. I am gonna work a bit more
on this but I wanted to share this with anyone who's interested. In case you
want to see it in action, we 've now got coveralls.io integration, so here you
are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a
href="https://coveralls.io/github/servermon/servermon"&gt;https://coveralls.io/github/servermon/servermon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is an increase from last year's 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.uname.gr/servermon-code-coverage-80.html"&gt;80% code coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alexandros Kosiaris</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2015 14:39:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.uname.gr,2015-09-11:servermon-code-coverage-95.html</guid><category>servermon</category><category>monitoring</category><category>puppet</category><category>django</category></item><item><title>collectd_transmission</title><link>http://blog.uname.gr/collectd_transmission.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;collectd_transmission just got version 2.3 released today. This is a small
project I 've create to integrate the collectd monitoring server and
transmission. It allows to monitor the state of a transmission server and get
some interesting info on the usage of it. I am quite exhited about it today
since I 've managed to make it reach 100% code coverage. It is a smallish
project, around 40 lines of actual code, close to 130 including spaces and
documentation but still 100% code coverage was not easy to achieve, mostly due
to the fact that it imports collectd, a on the fly created by collectd Python
module and injected into the namespace. Which meant mock. If you have never
heard about mocking in python, well it's time you do. If you do write any kind
of tests that is. It allows you to mock out all the difficult to reproduce
modules and functionalities allowing you to unit test your own code. That means
you won't escape bugs being introduced by libraries you use, but at
least you will be able to rule out your own code faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link for the coverage report at:
&lt;a

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the project itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a
href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collectd_transmission/"&gt;collectd_transmission
on PyPi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes it's on PyPI. Developed on github with readthedocs.org,
coveralls.io and travis-ci integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now getting a useful frontend to collectd might be a tad difficult. If you got
collectd pushing to a graphite instance, probably Grafana[1] is the best. If you
used RRDs and it's a single server, I use jarmon[2] and it's fine albeit slow.
That's mostly due to downloading all RRDs on every update. And it is just for
one server, its design does not allow more than one for sure. So unless it's
your toy server you are talking about, it's not for you.
Facette[3] seems to be a better alternative but it is still young.&lt;/p&gt;

multiple storage cabinets. Sample data has been updated so getting an idea how
this works should be easy. Just loaddata sampledata and head on to the web

coverage is over 80% as of a few days ago. What is code coverage you
might ask ? It is a metric about how much of your code actually get's
executed. Wikipedia article &lt;a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do note however that 100% code coverage does not mean 100%
code paths being executed but still, it is nice to have &amp;gt; 80%.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alexandros Kosiaris</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 14:39:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.uname.gr,2014-10-22:servermon-code-coverage-80.html</guid><category>servermon</category><category>monitoring</category><category>puppet</category><category>django</category></item></channel></rss>
