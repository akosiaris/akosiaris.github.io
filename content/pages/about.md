Title: About

So, what do you want to know about me ? I am a self proclaimed geek and
I tend to tend to rant about stuff. Professionally I am interested in
Systems engineering. Since May 2013 I provide services to the Wikimedia
Foundation. And I think I told enough about myself already

These days I am involved as the main developer of a server reporting and
inventory tool called [servermon](http://github.com/servermon/servermon)
