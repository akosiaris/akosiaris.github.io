Hello everyone, happy to shared with you that I 've managed to get servermon's
code coverage finally above 95%. 96.37 to be exact. This means only ~100
relevant LOC are not being actively tested right now. I am gonna work a bit more
on this but I wanted to share this with anyone who's interested. In case you
want to see it in action, we 've now got coveralls.io integration, so here you
are:

That is an increase from last year's 80%.
