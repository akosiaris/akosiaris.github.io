Just wanted to shared with everybody that servermon's python code
coverage is over 80% as of a few days ago. What is code coverage you
might ask ? It is a metric about how much of your code actually get's
executed. Wikipedia article <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">here</a>

Do note however that 100% code coverage does not mean 100%
code paths being executed but still, it is nice to have > 80%.
